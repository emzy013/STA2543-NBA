## STA2543 Project: NBA player salary prediction

### Introduction

We want to fit a model to predict NBA player's salary for 2021-2022 NBA season. We want to see if there are any other factors that would greatly effect a player's salary apart from his performance on the court.

### Data Source

- Player/team performance stats: basketball-reference.com
- Player salaries: hoopshype.com/salaries/players
- Player search trend: google.com
- NBA salary caps: spotrac.com/nba/cba/

### Salary

To more accurately represent salary, we calculate salary as the ratio/percentage of salary cap. The salary cap is a soft limit that a NBA team are allowed to pay their players.
